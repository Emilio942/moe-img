# Phase 3: Report on Expert Cooperation

This report summarizes the results of training the expert cooperation graph as defined in Phase 3 of the task list.

## 1. Summary

The training was successful after switching from dummy data to the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieves a reasonable accuracy (~48%), and the learnable expert graph (adjacency matrix) shows significant development.

The key finding is that with a sufficiently high L1 regularization penalty (`lambda=0.1`), the adjacency matrix becomes extremely sparse. This fulfills the done criteria for the task "2. Training des Kooperationsâ€‘Graphen".

## 2. Adjacency Matrix Heatmaps

The following heatmaps visualize the state of the expert adjacency matrix before and after training.

### Initial Matrix (Random)

### Final Matrix (After 10 Epochs)

As is clearly visible, the L1 penalty forced the vast majority of weights to zero, creating a sparse cooperation graph.

## 3. Routing Examples

The following is a sample of the expert routing decisions for a batch from the test set after 10 epochs. It shows the top-k indices of the selected experts and the final weights used for aggregation.
